## Access administration

To access administration section of Forumium, you need to login with an **administrator** user then visit the url: `/admin` (e.g. [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) if you are using the integrated Laravel server to serve Forumium).

Or, simply visit the `/admin` url, then the application will show you a **Login** form if you are not already logged in.
